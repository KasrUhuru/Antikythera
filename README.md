This is my personal text-based adventure game!

I have way too much creative energy, and all my head-in-the-clouds world building (a la Dungeons and Dragons) needs to go into something productive.

The biggest influences for my work are: (1) the Castlevania Netflix TV series; (2) Fear and Hunger combat mechanics and worldbuilding; (3) Warhammer 40K .

I have a deep appreciation for fantasy themes, but the genre of medieval fantasy is far too deeply rooted in Western European pre-Renaissance or Tolkien-esque influences.
Fantasy should have a relatable core of humanity, yes. However, we need to push the envelope of subject matter.

This game, tentatively titled 'Antikythera', will be rooted in influences from societies, cultures, and religions such as Zoroastrianism, 17th century Iran,
Native North American, and other polytheistic cultures that interact with one another. I anticipate some Abrahamic influences to bleed into my work, as I have
already identified a Messiah-adjacent figure in this game's history to be a figure of considerable contention for several factions. This was not intentional, but I am choosing to stay true to my work.

Setting: Middle-East inspired medieval "pre-Renaissance" levels of technology; dynamic countryside with rich green verdance, an arid desert, ominous subterranean cavescapes, 
mountainscapes, etc; post-apocalyptic, pre-rejuvenation era. Integrating lesser-known fantasy tropes with original creatures derived from folklore of the region. 

Themes: Resistance to Imperialism; influence of the Divine on the mundane; reconciliation of conflicting religious dogmas
